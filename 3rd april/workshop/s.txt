Study hard. 
• What others think of you is none of your business. 
• It's OK not to have all the answers. 
• Experiment, Fail, Learn and Repeat.
 Knowledge comes from experience. 
 Imagination is important. 
 • Do what interests you the most. 
 Stay curious.


 Things that Schools should teach: 
 • Being wrong is not a bad thing. 
 • It's Okay to question what you have been taught. 
 • Grades aren't as valuable as skills.
  Understanding is more important than memorization. 
  • Making mistakes is Okay. Learn from your mistakes.


  The problem is not people being uneducated. 
  The problem is that people are educated just enough to believe what they have been taught, and not educated enough to question anything from what they have been taught.
